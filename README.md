## The app that allows you to track re-occuring tasks

### Ensure you have Meteor installed:

    $ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh   

### Run the following to start the server:

    $ meteor

### Providing you have XCode and/or the Android SDK's configured correctly:

### Todo

- Gestures for sliding list items to the left and right
  - Sliding to the right should mark the item as done
  - Sliding to the left should delete the item
- Add a from now function for the dates
- Add the right classes for the items (green, yellow and red)
- Order the list appropriately
- See what happens with the bug about reactivity, could save two lines of code :D
- Integrate the slider
- Animations, animations, animations
- Push notifications?
